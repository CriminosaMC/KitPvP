### KitPvP

![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/CriminosaMC/KitPvP/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)

KitPvP is a small KitPvP plugin I've been working on. It's not really anything enterprise grade or anything that I would consider really using, however this was just a fun little project to eliminate the boredom I faced.

All the source code is available here - any pull requests/issues would be greatly appreciated.
